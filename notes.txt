1. Problem
Create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game where two players face each other. On the count of three, they both make a sign, at the exact same time, with one hand. The sign is either a rock (closed fist), paper (open palm), or scissors (two fingers, open like the victory sign).

Each sign can beat one (and only one) other:
- Rock smashes scissors
- Scissors cut paper
- Paper covers rock
- If both players choose the same sign, the game is a draw

the user has to click on of the buttons that represent one of the options (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Once user clicks the button, a computer randomly choosees one of these options too. The winner needs to have 3 points to win.

A user should have an option to press "Start" button to start the game
A user should have an option to press "Play Again" button to reset the game once he wins
A user should be able to see scores 


PSEUDO CODE:

playerScore = 0;
computerScore = 0;
map with keys and values (1,2,3 and rock, paper, scissors)



When a user presses start button
	Hide "Rock Paper Scissors" and Start Button
	Show elements with Computer, Score (take score from computerScore variable), text "Rock Paper Scissors?"

When a user presses emoji
	run FUNTION rockPaperScissors
	take users input number from dataset HTML attribute.
	iterate through map and find out what input that is and assign it to variable userSelection
	
	generate random number between 1 and 3
	1 = rock
	2 = paper
	3 = scissors
	iterate through map and find out what input that is and assing it to variable computerSelection
