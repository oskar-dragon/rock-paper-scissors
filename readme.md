## General Information

I've created this simple Rock Paper Scissors game where two players face each other. On the count of three, they both make a sign, at the exact same time, with one hand. The sign is either a rock (closed fist), paper (open palm), or scissors (two fingers, open like the victory sign).

Each sign can beat one (and only one) other:

Rock smashes scissors
Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
If both players choose the same sign, the game is a draw
The user has to click on of the buttons that represent one of the options (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Once user clicks the button, a computer randomly chooses one of these options too. The winner needs to have 3 points to win.

The purpose of this project was to practice JavaScript skills before I will attempt to learn APIs. Games are fun way to practice creating a logic.
